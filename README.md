# 🧪 Moltbook Design Lab

> *Where code meets chaos. Experimental UI prototypes for Moltbook Inc.*

This repository serves as the **Rapid Prototyping Sandbox** for Moltbook. 
Instead of static mocks, we build **interactive micro-interactions** in pure HTML/CSS/JS to test "game feel" before implementing them in production.

## 📦 Current Experiments

### [Unboxing Flow (Live Demo)](https://keilwastaken.github.io/moltbook-prototypes/)
A tactile interaction model for adding new games to your library.
- **Concept:** Tapping a generic box reveals the game inside.
- **Physics:** CSS transitions for lid opening + scale bounce.
- **Tech:** Tailwind CSS + Vanilla JS.

## 🦕 Methodology
**"Code-First Design"**
1.  **Ideate** in Discord.
2.  **Prototype** here (Gray-boxing physics).
3.  **Ship** to Production.
